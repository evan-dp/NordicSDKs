nRF5 SDK for Thread v0.11.0
---------------------------
Release Date: Week 47, 2017

This release is an experimental release and should only be used to explore 
and try out the Thread features available on the nRF52840 chip.

The Thread examples in this pack are built on top of the OpenThread stack:
https://github.com/openthread/openthread

Software components and application examples for MDK, peripherals, BLE and NFC
have been inherited from nRF5 SDK v14.1.0.

New features:
- Added Segger Embedded Studio (SES) IDE support.
- Added Keil MDK-ARM IDE support.
- Added new examples demonstrating:
  - MQTT-SN Publisher and Subscriber
  - Measurements of packet error rate (PER)
  - NFC pairing in BLE NUS (Nordic UART Service) with Thread MTD running CoAP Client
- Added support for Multicast DFU.
- Added USB transport for CLI and NCP examples.
- Added support for Thread Sleepy End Device role in dynamic multiprotocol solution.
- Added support for Thread sniffer using NCP software.

Changes:
- Updated SDK codebase to nRF5 SDK v14.1.0.
- Updated pre-built OpenThread libraries for all supported toolchains.
- Updated Thread Border Router.
- Introduced Thread and CoAP utils common for all examples.
- Power-optimized all Thread examples.
- Modified the advertising interval of the BLE Eddystone Beacon Example to work with Timeslot API.

Limitations:
- Interrupts with priority 0-4 shall not be used for multiprotocol Thread/BLE examples.
- Due to Thread Harness issue and non-compliant implementation of Golden Devices in the Thread Test Bed,
  several certification tests fail (https://threadgroup.atlassian.net/browse/TESTPLAN-380).
- MQTT-SN client does not support SED role.
- Multiprotocol example ble_thread_dyn_hrs_coap_srv_freertos does not work without optimization.
  For GCC, SES and Keil, the application running with no optimization has undefined behavior.

nRF5 SDK modification:
- Modified the nrf_drv_clock module to set HFCLK state correctly with the SoftDevice.
- Introduced a new option FDS_VIRTUAL_PAGES_RESERVED to the FDS module to prevent 
  overwriting of OpenThread's persistent data.
- Added Block2 option support and minor fixes to the IoT CoAP library.
- Modified the Secure DFU library to enable compilation without linking to BLE transport.

Compatible tools:
- nrfutil-3.4.0
- nRF Thread Topology Monitor (nRF TTM) v0.11.0-1.alpha
- RaspPi-Thread-Border-Router-Demo v0.11.0-1.alpha
These tools are available from https://www.nordicsemi.com/thread#Downloads

Supported SoftDevices for multiprotocol support:
- S140 v5.0.0-2.alpha

The following OpenThread commit has been used to generate pre-built Thread
stack libraries, and for testing and verification:
- https://github.com/openthread/openthread/commit/a89eb887

The following wpantund commit has been used as part of the Thread
Border Router solution, and for testing and verification:
https://github.com/openthread/wpantund/commit/418ff17

Certification:
The OpenThread stack has been officially certified on nRF52840 as Thread Group Certified Component.

For certification, the following Thread Harness version has been used:
- Thread V1.1 Test Harness Release 1.1.0 R45

The following OpenThread commit has been used to generate stack libraries:
- https://github.com/openthread/openthread/commit/cfc84c02
- With revert of https://github.com/openthread/openthread/commit/9d66542e commit

The above commit has been reverted because of a known issue in Thread Harness and Thread Test Bed:
 - https://threadgroup.atlassian.net/browse/TESTPLAN-380

While performing Thread Certification tests for Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52840 multiprotocol SoC,
the chip was constantly connected as a Bluetooth low energy 5 peripheral device to a Bluetooth low energy central node,
in addition to performing the Device Under Test (DUT) role for Thread Test Bed. The Bluetooth low energy bit rate was 1 Mbit/s,
and the connection interval was 200 ms. Each node transmitted 18-19 ATT payload bytes to the peer in average 1 s interval.

The following toolchains have been used for testing and verification of the
Thread examples:
- SES: SES 3.30
- ARM: MDK-ARM version 5.18a
- GCC: GCC ARM Embedded 4.9 2015q3
- IAR: IAR Workbench 7.80.4

Supported boards:
- PCA10056
